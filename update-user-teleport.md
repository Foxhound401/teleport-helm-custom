### User can be upate to add more permission

TODO: update this document for more detail on how to do this on the command line so we 
can automate it.


=> Currently solve this issue by using the teleport GUI, Create a new role with access permission

=> Gotchas: you will need to logout and log back in for the permission to take effect, I believe this have something to do with session.
